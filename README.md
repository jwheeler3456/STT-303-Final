# STT-303-Final
This project analyzes breast cancer gene expression data from the TCGA-BRCA cohort. The focus is on three key genes: BRCA1, TP53, and ESR1. The R script downloads and processes the data, performs statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA), clustering (K-means), logistic regression, and survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier curves). The goal is to explore associations between gene expression and patient survival outcomes.
